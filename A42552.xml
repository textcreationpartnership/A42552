            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Elizabeth Aſhe</hi> of <hi>Alſted,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent;</hi> and to her Eldeſt and hopefull Son <hi>William Aſhe</hi> Eſquire.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great God needeth none of his creatures, nor any of their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all the ſervice he requireth of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tendeth to their own good, and is no way beneficiall to him; to think to add any thing to him, is to guild gold, or light a Candle at noon-day: God is eternall, and was everlaſtingly bleſſed, before one Angel was created to attend him, as now there be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb facs="tcp:38295:3"/> miniſtring unto him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was one man formed on earth to praiſe him, and do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as now there are variety of creatures to ſet forth his praiſe: God is infinitely above all advantages, which any of the ſervices of the ſons of men can afford unto him: a drop is more to the Ocean, than all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of men are to God: If God had needed the world, or any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he could have made it long before; but Himſelf is his own bleſſedneſse; he is fully ſatisfied in himſelf; it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to him to be infinitely happy; therefore as his being, ſo his bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse is eſſentiall to him: he is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſelf-ſufficient, and infinitely happy in his own moſt glorious and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellencies. There is then in God enough to ſatisfie the ſouls of men and women; for if there be enough in him to ſatisfie himſelf, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, then who cannot think but there is enough in him, to ſatisfie all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite capacities of poor mortals? the
<pb facs="tcp:38295:3"/> ſpring of all our wants ariſeth from our distance from God; and indeed there is no want can make us truly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, but our want of enjoying God. We may caſt about us, thinking to help our ſelves in our ſtraits and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences many wayes; but till we come to God, and feed upon his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, our diſeaſe will never be cured.</p>
            <p>The proper habitation of the ſoul is God himſelf; and none are ſo well houſed, as they that have God for their dwelling place; when God iS a man's habitation, there do the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels keep the door: happy is that ſoul that lodgeth in the boſome of his love; that ſeeth his face, and walketh in the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; the more it is raiſed up above luſts and creature-comforts, the more taken up with the contemplation of the love of God, the more do the will and affections run out after him. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts tell us, that the Bees hate all artificiall ſavours; ſo he that hath been at the fountain of life, and
<pb facs="tcp:38295:4"/> drunk a large draught of the river of his pleaſures, will not ſeek to quench his thirſt at any broken Ciſtern, that can hold no water. Our corrupt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits think, that unleſs we can ſatisfie ſuch a luſt, enjoy ſuch a friend, and ſo much of creature-comforts, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well with us; but theſe are but meer deluſions of the Devil; for a man that wanteth God, to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for any externall thing, and to think to help himſelf by the creature, it is but to adde vanity to vanity, and in fine miſery to miſery: for when a man expecteth ſatisfaction, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing leſs, his miſery is ſo much the more increaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auguſtine</hi> tells us of three ſorts of men, that be not happy in this life: The firſt, he that enjoyeth not the thing he loveth, whether the thing he loveth be good or evil: The ſecond, he that enjoyeth what he loveth, but the thing that he enjoyeth is not good for him: The third, he that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is good for him, but he takes
<pb facs="tcp:38295:4"/> no delight nor comfort in it: To all theſe he anſwereth in a word; <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus cruciatur, ſecundus fallitur, tertius aegrotat;</hi> The firſt is diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaith he, vext and tormented, becauſe he hath not what he would have; he is not happy, becauſe he is diſquieted: The ſecond, (he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth what he loveth, but the thing he enjoyeth is not good for him) ſuch a one is deceived and deluded with a ſhew of happineſſe; the thing is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, and therefore is not happy in his enjoyment: The third, he that poſſeſſeth what is good for him, but he loveth it not, he is ſick and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, his heart is very much out of frame: but he that enjoyeth God, hath that which is beſt for him, and poſſeſſeth him, and this is true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
            <p>It is altogether impoſſible for man to be made happy, by any thing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to himſelf: there is ſomething in man, ſuperiour to any earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> a reaſonable ſoul; and
<pb facs="tcp:38295:5"/> there is nothing in worldly honours, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is comparable to the ſubstance or faculties of man's intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall ſoul: therefore if man cannot find happineſſe in himſelf, it is in vain to ſeek it in any earthly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary thing; I mean true happineſs, and reall ſatisfaction. Man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be happy, but by the poſſeſſion of ſomething more excellent than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cannot poſſeſſe any true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, till he comes to the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God. There is no one outward thing, that can relieve us in all our wants: meat nouriſheth us, but cloaths us not: our garments cover us, but feed us not: gold enricheth us, but defends us not from any danger: one good produceth but one ſingle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us but thoſe that daily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon God,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.19.</note> do find enough in him to ſatisfie all their deſires: he hath riches enough in himſelf to ſupply all our wants; and indeed ſuch is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of man's heart, that none but an infinite God can fill it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38295:5"/>
            <p>And now the deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Meditation (which I moſt humbly preſent unto you) is to lead us frequently to God, who leads us to Heaven; and what greater delight, than to be led to Heaven, by him that dwells there? our hearts are like a ſpring-lock that ſhut themſelves, but do not open to any thing that is good; therefore we muſt open them every day with the key of meditation: and as in naturall things, thoſe that be highest, and neareſt to the Heavens, are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and cleareſt, and come neareſt to the nature thereof; as the Element of fire, and the upper region of the Air be more pure and free from groſs matter, than the middle and lower region, where the clouds and miſts be ingendred; ſo thoſe that draw near to God by holy meditation, and are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in this heavenly exerciſe, are pure from thoſe groſſe ſins, with which others pollute themſelves: otherwiſe men in high places may not unfitly be reſembled to the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:38295:6"/> whom Aſtronomers and Philoſophers tell us, that in ſphear and place he is neareſt to the Heavens, but in nature and quality moſt unlike them, and leaſt of all partaking of the influences of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Let me beſeech you still to keep cloſe to God, and then the Lord will ſtick cloſe to you, and vouchſafe his preſence with you. Among all Rules of policy, theſe are the chiefeſt: to be faithfull and upright to the Lord; to aim at his glory; to be guided by his Spirit; and walk according to the rule of his Word; then may you be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that you are more ſafe under his protection, than any arm of fleſh can make you. I humbly crave your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this my boldneſs; and that the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, may bleſs you with all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt, is, and ſhall be the prayer of</p>

                  <p>Let us now draw forth our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on Hell,<note place="margin">Hell the tenth ſubject of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> and firſt let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the names of the place prepared for the damned: It is called <hi>Tophet, Iſa.</hi> 30.33. whence <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, the Latine word <hi>Gehenna</hi> cometh, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is called <hi>Utter darkneſs,</hi> Matth. 22.13. ſometime it is called <hi>Infernus,</hi> a place beneath, a place moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and furtheſt remote from Heaven,<note place="margin">Nunquàm erit homini pejus in morte, quam ubi erit mors ſine morte.</note> to ſignifie the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and dejected eſtate of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſhall be even trod upon and trampled under the feet of the godly, <hi>Malac.</hi> 4.3. Thus they that now would put their hands under their feet, becauſe there is yet hope they may do them good, ſhall then be ſo far from pittying, as they ſhall praiſe God for plaguing and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; its called alſo a burning lake, the ſecond Death or Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider we the ſorts of the puniſhments of the damned.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhall be tormented with the worm of conſcience, the never dying worm: this worm that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38295:78"/> ſhall gnaw the wicked in hell, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the guilt of an evil conſcience, thoroughly awakened in hell; called a Worm, becauſe as worms proceed from putrefaction, and do torment by biting and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo this worm proceedeth from the putrefaction of ſin, afflicteth by gnawing and tormenting the ſinner for ever: Though the conſciences of wicked men are ſometime aſleep in this life; and though they commit many notorious ſins, and they have a dull and ſleepy conſcience, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſenſe of what they do; and though ſometime they put out the eye of conſcience, and cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between moral good and evil; and though they have a ſecure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which thinks not of any penal evil, and ſo they ſeldome think of Hell torments; and though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they put a muzzle upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and labour to ſtop its mouth; and though ſometime their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are cauterized, and become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſenſeleſs, yet when they come to dye, but eſpecially when they go into Hell, their conſciences
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38295:78"/> ſhall be perfectly awakened and that for ever; then wicked men will even gnaſh their teeth, becauſe conſcience did no ſooner uſe its teeth, they will then gnaw their tongues for ſorrow, becauſe conſcience had no tongue to ſpeak, nor they no ears to hear what it ſpake till it was too late: Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath a reflecting power, and when ſinners come into hell, all the evils that ever they have done ſhall come freſh to their remembrance; as the glorious Saints do remember all the good that ever they have done here, for their comfort; ſo the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hell ſhall remember all the evil that ever they have done for the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their miſery; they ſhall then call to minde all the evil they have done, and all the good they have left undone, the means of grace that hath been offered them, and they have ſlighted, the thoughts whereof ſhall ſting them for ever.</p>

                  <p>There are three things in this world which oppoſe our happineſſe, and hinder us from knowing God perfectly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is his greatneſſe which aſtoniſheth us: therefore he is ſaid to dwell in light to which no mortall can approach, and the darkneſſe is ſaid to cover him, and hide him from our ſight.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is his abſence: for though he be in every place, yet when he pleaſeth, he hideth his face, and withdraweth his preſence from us.</p>
                  <p>The third is our impotency, which cannot here abide a full manifeſtation of the glorious preſence of God: but in Heaven all theſe hindrances ſhall be taken away from the bleſſed; God's Majeſty is no longer terrible; his greatneſſe which here is aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, ſhall then give being to our felicity; and the love of God having caſt out all fear from our hearts, we ſhall then treat with our Soveraign as our beloved friend; we ſhall not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38295:86"/> then lament the abſence of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, but be poſſeſſed by him whom we poſſeſſe; we ſhall be as full of God as our hearts can hold or deſire.</p>
                  <p>And as the knowledge, ſo alſo the love of the Saints to God in Heaven ſhall be compleat: here our love to him is very ſlender; it is faint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we poſſeſſe not the higheſt good which we moſt ardently affect, and being ſeperated from him, we are as well his Martyrs, as his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>Tùnc implebuntur vota: but then</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard, ſhall our longing be ſatisfied, and our deſires accompliſhed:</hi> here our love is divided, becauſe ſelf-love is not yet extinguiſhed; and the more we indulge our ſelves, the more we rob God of his due: we love not God ſo purely, as not to ſeek our ſelves when we pretend to ſeek his glory: we are here more earneſt with him for riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, than for graces; but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven our love ſhall be free from ſuch imperfections: our love ſhall not then be blind, becauſe we ſhall ſee him whom we love; and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour

               <p>Seaſon your minds in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch meditations as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Meditate on the great favour which God hath vouchſafed to thee the night paſt; and if thou haſt not remembred God upon thy bed; nor thy reins inſtructed thee in the night ſeaſon; and if God hath not been in all thy thoughts, think of humbling
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38295:91"/> thy ſelf before him, and crave his pardon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the morning meditate thus with thy ſelf: this day is given me to give all diligence, to make my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure; to obtain eternall life; to take a firm reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to imploy my whole life to that purpoſe; and to think ſeriouſly of the reckoning I muſt give to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditate upon what affairs thou maiſt meet with the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as helps or hindrances to thee in God's ſervice: uſe the beſt means of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to promote thy ſervice of God; and think how thou maiſt carefully reſiſt, and overcome whatever is contrary to God's glory, and thy ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Meditate how unable thou art to perform any pious reſolutions, be they either to ſhun the evil, or do the thing that is good; and offer up thy heart in the morning, with all thy holy purpoſes, to the heavenly Majeſty, praying him to take it and them into his gracious protection.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Think with thy ſelf every morning: this day for ought that I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:38295:92"/> know, may be my laſt day; how ought I then ſo to ſpend this day, as though death were preſently to arreſt me. By theſe or the like morning meditations, all that ſhall be done the day after, may be bedewed with the bleſſing of Heaven.</p>
               <p>As in the morning you are to take a ſpirituall repaſt by meditation; ſo in the evening 'tis neceſſary to take a devout and ſpirituall collation. <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi> in my Text went out in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meditate: One adviſeth, that <hi>meditation be our key to open the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our lock to cloſe the evening withall.</hi> Get a little leiſure after all your wordly imployments, to call up your ſpirits to the conſideration of ſome holy object, which thou maiſt preſent to thy ſelf ſimply, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward caſt of thy thought, kindling the fire of meditation in thy heart, by a few holy inſpirations and ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to the Lord, either in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what thou haſt beſt reliſhed in thy morning meditations, or by ſome other as thou beſt likeſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch meditations as theſe in the evening, before our going to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38295:92"/> bed, may not be unprofitable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To meditate on God's great goodneſſe, in preſerving thee the day before, from many troops of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that lay in ambuſcado againſt thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To meditate and examine thy ſelf, how thou haſt carried thy ſelf in every part of the day; which to do the more eaſily, you are to conſider with whom, and in what imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you have been buſied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a man hath done any good, to think of praiſing God for it; if any ill, in thought, word, or deed, to be humbled, and ask pardon for it, with a reſolution carefully to amend it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So to end the day in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that by our morning exerciſe, we may open the windows of our ſouls to the Sun of righteouſneſſe, and going to take ſuch reſt as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us, we ſhut them up againſt the Prince of darkneſſe.</p>

Meditation doth not reveal any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth unto us, that only is the work of God; but after God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them, faith apprehends them: then meditation illuſtrates to the ſoul what faith believes, and ſo our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is encreaſed: many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation rectifies the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoul: it oppoſeth ſerious conſiderations againſt vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and becauſe our imagination is apt to raiſe falſe objects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by falſe conceits and diſcourſes in us, therefore meditation propoundeth true objects for the mind to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the meditation whereof, the ſoul rightly conceives of things, and diſcourſeth upon true grounds of them, meditating thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if things be thus and thus in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, then muſt I live according to theſe principles: this is the ſpring of all holy affections in the ſoul, as the true love of God; the true joy and delight in him and his wayes. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is like the player on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, who by touching of the ſtrings, finds them that are out of tune, winding them up, or letting them down; ſo after meditation hath examined the love, the hate, the fears, the hopes, the griefs, the joyes of our ſouls, if it find them out of tune in expreſſing their harmony,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:38295:105"/> which is the glory of God, it then puts them in tune again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation fills the heart with joy: <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet; I will be glad in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 104.34. When the Spirit of God doth open the eyes of the ſoul, and it is brought forth into the light, then doth meditation clear up to the ſoul thoſe grounds of joy, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfortable. Holy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhews the ſoul the face of God reconciled; his pardon ſealed; an entrance into the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the heart of God opened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him; and his name written in Heaven.<note place="margin">Activa vira ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet ſolicitum curſum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templativa gaudium ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternum. <hi>Prosper.</hi> l. 1 de contempl. virâ.</note> Meditation clears up the promiſes to him, that he never ſaw before: he ſaw them before as by Candle-light, by common light and reaſon; but now he ſeeth them in another complexion. Meditation clears up their intereſt in God and his promiſes; and this is great matter of rejoycing. Meditation works in the ſoul a frame of heart, ſuitable to the Goſpel; what is more ſuitable to the Goſpel, than the joyes of the holy Ghoſt? therefore when meditation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38295:105"/> works thorowly upon the heart, it yeeldeth comforts ſuitable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. It is good for Chriſtians to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate much in God's promiſes, which do convey much joy into the heart: then doſt thou improve the promiſes, when thou doſt ſo reliſh them, as to rejoyce in them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſweetneſſe that is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contained in them.</p>

Meditation labours to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the heart with the ſenſe of God's continuall preſence with it: this is indeed our great weakneſſe, and our great unthankfulneſſe, that we are apt to muſe more upon God's afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, than of God's perpetuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38295:106"/> with us: there is a ſavour in the ointments of the Lord Chriſt, ſufficient to perfume any ſoul that comes near him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Frequent meditation on God, makes a man more holy, more like unto him; it ſees ſo much beauty and goodneſſe in him, that it makes a man caſt away every unſavoury luſt, and all thoſe affections that have a ſtrong ſent of the fleſh, that they may be made like to God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Thoſe Flowers that grow in the Sun, are far more beautifull, and fragrant, and pleaſant, than thoſe that grow in the ſhade; but if we ſuffer our ſouls to be over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with carnall thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, theſe dark bodies will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between God and us, and hinder the influences of his love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: If the Needle that is but toucht with the Loadſtone, ſtands Northward; then the ſoul that is toucht with God, will ſtand Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and labour to be conformed more to him in holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Meditation is a great help to perſeverance in well-doing: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38295:106"/> and frequent meditation of this promiſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.12, 14.</note> that <hi>the Lord will not caſt off his people, nor forſake his inheritance,</hi> makes them to cleave faſt unto him. This is the foundation of a peoples bleſſedneſſe, that God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, when he doth moſt ſharply correct them; that the ſame priviledge that belongs to the whole Church, belongs to every member of it; for it is as poſſible for God to caſt off his people, and his whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as to caſt off any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of it: for, for God to caſt off his people, were to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit himſelf; God would have his people to meditate hereof. Thus ſaith God to <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 33.24, 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſidereſt thou not what this people have spoken, ſaying, the two families which the Lord hath choſen, he hath caſt them off:</hi> but in the words following, ſee how God doth aſſert his unchangeable Covenant, againſt this falſe aſſertion: <hi>If my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the Ordinances of Heaven and earth, then will I caſt away the ſeed of Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, If ever you knew a day, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38295:107"/> had not a night ſucceeding it, and a winter without a ſummer, and ever found the Laws of Heaven abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then may you give way to your unbelief, and think that I will caſt off my people; but if you ſee a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all interchange of day and night, though ſome dayes be more bright than others, then will I never caſt off any people, that I have taken for my own. The meditation hereof, is a ſpeciall means to keep us cloſe to God, even then when the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth are ſhaken.</p>

                  </note>7. Meditation is a ſtrong barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do againſt the temptations of Satan: the ſoul finds ſo much ſweetneſſe in God, that it ſtrongly guardeth the heart, will and affections, againſt temptations to ſin; it finds ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the meditation of God, that it loaths the ſweeteſt ſin. He that is uſed to choice meats and drinks, can very ill brook unſavoury things; ſo a man that is heavenly minded, is brought to diſreliſh thoſe ſins, that others drink down like water with greedineſſe: meditation makes the heart very tender, and ſenſible of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:38295:107"/> leſſer ſins, and ſtirrings of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In a ſtill, ſilent, clear night, a little ſound will be eaſily heard, which will not be taken notice of in the day time, when there is much buſineſſe in hand; ſo when Chriſt and the ſoul do reſt, and converſe together, the ſoul is very quick of hearing: if the old Serpent doth but hiſſe never ſo little, Satan then finds the ſoul upon its guard, and that it hath a wakefull enemy. A ſoul that is conſtant in the meditation of God, is like a bright clear ſhiny day, when any little cloud will be taken notice of, at the firſt riſing; and like a calm Sea, where a little ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the water will be diſcerned, when the water firſt ariſeth.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:38295:108"/> we come neareſt to the purity and ſimplicity of God: in nothing do we more converſe with him, than in our pure and active meditations: by theſe when we are as it were abſent in body, we are preſent with him; for when the body lyes upon its bed, and takes its reſt, the devout ſoul ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceth it ſelf with God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This exerciſe of meditation may be done, when other duties cannot. When we want an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to hear the Word, to read, to pray ſolemnly, we may have liberty to confer with God by holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Meditation brings the ſoul to reſt it ſelf in God. One ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Struth.</hi> Obſerv. 87. Cent. 2.</note> that <hi>contemplation is both the labour and the reſt of the devout ſoul:</hi> it carries up the ſpirit of man into the boſome of God's love; it exalts a man ſo high, as to make him look down upon theſe ſublunary things with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 9.33.</note> following Chriſt to the Mount, where he was transfigured, ſeeing ſome of his glory, cried out, <hi>Maſter it is good for us to be here:</hi> ſo when a Chriſtian follows Chriſt upon the Mount of meditation, he is where he would be; he cryes out, it is good for me to be here.</p>

               <p n="5">5. A man given to meditation, is a growing Chriſtian. As holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations do thrive with us, and abide in us; ſo doth the grace of God increaſe in us: holy meditations are good tokens of preſent grace, and do enkindle ſtrong deſires after more grace: the man that is barren in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, is barren and unfruitfull in grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Meditation is a great evidence of ſincerity. As men may know us by our actions, as the tree is known by his fruit: ſo a man may know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his conſtant thoughts; <hi>for as he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he,</hi> Prov. 23.7. And God looks not ſo much upon what we do, as upon what our hearts are moſt upon; not ſo much upon what is uttered by the lips, as upon what the heart indites: by this we draw vertue from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and are full of the life of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Meditation is a Chriſtian's Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon earth. <hi>This is,</hi> as one ſaith, <hi>the meaſure that God gives in this life; a beginning that ſhall be finiſhed; an earnest that ſhall be followed with the full ſumme.</hi> The ſoul that keeps
